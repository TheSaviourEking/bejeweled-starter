1. **Project Overview**:
   - The project involves creating a command-line Bejeweled game.
   - It starts by implementing test specifications (specs) for the game logic in `bejeweled-spec.js`.
   - After that, the actual game logic should be implemented in `bejeweled.js`.
   - A `Screen` API is provided to handle command-line rendering, and it should be used to display the game.

2. **Screen API**:
   - The `Screen` API is responsible for handling command-line rendering.
   - You don't need to understand the internal workings of the `Screen` code, but you should use the provided commands.
   - Commands can be added to the `Screen` API using `Screen.addCommand(key, description, action)` to respond to keypresses.
   - The `Screen` API includes methods for setting grid elements, colors, and handling quitting and rendering.

3. **Bejeweled Rules**:
   - Bejeweled is a game where you match three of the same item in a row either horizontally or vertically by swapping items.
   - Matching three items causes them to disappear, and new items fall from the top to fill the gaps.
   - Swaps can only occur between adjacent items.

4. **Running the Game**:
   - To run the game, follow these steps:
     1. Install necessary packages using `npm install`.
     2. Run the game with `node game.js`.
     3. Run tests with `mocha`.

5. **Tasks**:
   - There are several tasks to complete for the project, including:
     1. Implement tests in `test/bejeweled-spec.js` for the Bejeweled game logic.
     2. Update tests in `test/cursor-spec.js` to handle selecting and swapping gems.
     3. Fill out game logic in `class/bejeweled.js` until all tests in `test/bejeweled-spec.js` pass.
     4. Update cursor logic in `class/cursor.js` until all tests in `test/cursor-spec.js` pass.
     5. Use `setBackgroundColor` and `resetBackgroundColor` in `cursor.js` to highlight the cursor's position on the grid.
     6. Create commands in `bejeweled.js` to select gems and execute swaps.
     7. Implement game state in `bejeweled.js` to check for match-3s.
     8. Chain the game state to check and alert the player for match combos.
     9. Implement a scoring system for the player based on matches and combos.

6. **Screen API Details**:
   - The `Screen` API includes methods for initializing, setting gridlines, adding commands, updating the grid, quitting, rendering, and displaying messages.

These are the key points and tasks outlined in the requirements. They provide a clear roadmap for developing the Bejeweled game, starting from writing tests for game logic to implementing the gameplay mechanics using the provided `Screen` API.


--------------

Certainly, let's delve into the game logic for this Bejeweled project:

**Bejeweled Game Logic**:

The Bejeweled game is a puzzle game where the player's goal is to match three or more identical items either horizontally or vertically on a grid. To implement the game logic, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Game Grid**:
   - Create a grid that represents the game board. This grid should contain different types of gems or items that the player can match.
   - You can initialize the grid with random gems at the start of the game.

2. **Swapping Gems**:
   - Allow the player to select two adjacent gems and swap their positions on the grid.
   - Ensure that gems can only be swapped if the swap results in a valid match.
   - Implement logic to check if the swap results in a match of three or more identical gems either horizontally or vertically.

3. **Matching Gems**:
   - When three or more identical gems are aligned either horizontally or vertically, remove them from the grid.
   - Update the player's score based on the number of matched gems.

4. **Filling Empty Spaces**:
   - After gems are removed from the grid, allow gems from above to fall into the empty spaces.
   - Generate new random gems to fill the remaining gaps.

5. **Combo Matches**:
   - Implement logic to detect multiple matches that occur as a result of falling gems or new gems appearing.
   - Calculate and update the player's score for combo matches.

6. **Winning and Losing**:
   - Define conditions for winning the game, such as reaching a target score.
   - Implement conditions for losing, such as running out of valid moves.

7. **User Interface**:
   - Use the provided `Screen` API to display the game board and update it whenever there are changes.
   - Create a command in `bejeweled.js` to handle gem selection and swapping when the player presses keys.
   - Highlight the selected gems and visually indicate when a swap is about to happen.

8. **End Game Handling**:
   - Determine how the game ends and handle the end game state, whether it's a win or loss.
   - Display a message to inform the player of the game's outcome.

9. **Scoring**:
   - Keep track of the player's score based on the number of matched gems and combos.
   - Update and display the player's score on the screen.

10. **Testing**:
    - Continuously test the game logic by running the provided tests in `test/bejeweled-spec.js`.
    - Ensure that all game mechanics work as expected and pass the tests.

Remember to follow the project's guidelines and use the provided `Screen` API for rendering and user input handling. By implementing these steps, you'll create a functional Bejeweled game with clear game logic and user interaction.
